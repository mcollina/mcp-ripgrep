# MCP Ripgrep Server

An MCP server that provides ripgrep (rg) search capabilities to any MCP client such as Claude.

## Overview

This server provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for the powerful [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) search tool. It enables Claude AI and other MCP-compatible clients to perform high-performance text searches across files on your system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- ripgrep (`rg`) command installed and available in your PATH. Install it with `brew install ripgrep` on macOS.

## Usage with Claude for Desktop

To use this MCP server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Edit your Claude for Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following to your configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ripgrep": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-ripgrep@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   Replace `/path/to/mcp-ripgrep` with the absolute path to where you cloned this repository.

3. Restart Claude for Desktop.
